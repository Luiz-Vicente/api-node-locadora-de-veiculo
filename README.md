**This project is not finished.**

There is still a lot to be done, such as:
- re-organize folders and files
- rename variables and functions
- componentize front-end elements
- separate backend responsibilities
- use patterns to consume APIs on the Front-end
- create dockerfile for database
- create dockerfile for the project itself
- separate production and development versions
- use style libraries
- redo the Front-end layout

I forked @ymandy1 project and just changed the way editing a vehicle is done.

Follow me and follow the development of this project.
